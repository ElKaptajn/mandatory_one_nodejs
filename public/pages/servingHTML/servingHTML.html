    <h2 class="mb-3">Loop Methods - map, filter, reduce</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">JavaScript provides various loop methods like map, filter, and reduce, each with a specific purpose. Map is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the existing array. Filter returns a new array containing elements that satisfy a specific condition. Below is a image of how you can use the two loops.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Functional Approach to Loops and Side Effects</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A functional approach to loops emphasizes immutability, statelessness, and the absence of side effects. This approach often leads to more reliable and maintainable code. When using functional programming patterns, developers avoid modifying variables or data structures outside the scope of the function. Instead, they focus on producing new values or data structures. By implementing loops with a functional approach, developers can minimize side effects, improve code testability, and create more predictable behavior.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Understanding node_modules</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The node_modules folder is a crucial part of any Node.js project, as it houses all the installed dependencies and their respective files. When a developer installs a package using a package manager like npm, the package and its dependencies are stored within the node_modules folder.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Security and Serving Static Files in Express</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Serving static files securely is an essential aspect of web application development. In Express, developers can serve static files like images, stylesheets, or scripts using the built-in middleware function, "express.static()".</p>
