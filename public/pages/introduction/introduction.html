    <h2 class="mb-3">Git in the terminal</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Git through the terminal allows developers to manage version control efficiently. From here the developers can work on the same project without interfering with each others code. In the picture below you can see how to push your code to a github repository from the terminal.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Choose what part of your code should be added. For instance -A means all the code. "." means all the code in this folder</li>
        <li>Step 2: Write a message to the commit</li>
        <li>Step 3: Push the code to the repository</li>
        <li>Step 4: You are done! THe code is now available to those you shared it with on Github</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Data types in JavaScript</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">JavaScript supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and arrays, among others. By utilizing the appropriate data types and their respective properties, developers can manipulate data, store information, and perform complex operations to create interactive and dynamic applications.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Node.js</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript code outside of a browser. It utilizes the V8 engine to run JavaScript on the server. Running files with Node.js is done as follows: with a command like "node filename.js", developers can execute server-side JavaScript code, opening up numerous possibilities for creating web applications, APIs, and more</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">REST api</h2>
    <img src="/assets/images/rest-api.png" alt="REST API" class="mx-auto d-block mb-4">
    <p class="mb-4">Designing a REST (Representational State Transfer) API involves creating a set of rules and conventions for accessing and manipulating resources over the web. A well-designed REST API should be scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand. Key principles include using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (in that order!)), consistent and meaningful resource naming, and leveraging status codes to communicate the outcome of API requests.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Clean Code and Code Conventions</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Clean code and adherence to code conventions are vital for maintaining high-quality software. Writing clean code enhances readability, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase. Code conventions, such as consistent indentation, naming conventions, and organizing code into modular components, improve the structure and maintainability of the code. Following these practices reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs, simplifies debugging, and promotes effective collaboration among team members.</p>
