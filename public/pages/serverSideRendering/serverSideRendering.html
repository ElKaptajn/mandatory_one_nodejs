<h2 class="mb-3">Reading HTML files</h2>
<p class="mb-4">In Node.js applications, developers often need to read and serve HTML files to clients. The 'fs' (file system) module allows developers to read files, while Express can be used to serve the HTML content. This approach enables developers to create dynamic web applications, separate templates from the server logic, and reuse HTML components.</p>

<h2 class="mb-3">Nodemon Extension</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Nodemon is a useful utility for Node.js developers, as it automatically restarts the application when changes are detected in the source files. By using Nodemon during development, developers can save time by avoiding manual restarts and focus on writing code. You can edit your nodemon settings by creating a nodemon.js file in for root directory. You can install nodemon with npm like this: "npm i nodemon"</p>
